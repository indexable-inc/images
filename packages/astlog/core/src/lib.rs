//! Datalog over tree-sitter syntax trees.
//!
//! Tree-sitter query matches become relations (one row per match, columns
//! named by `@capture`), Datalog rules join them — structurally (`ancestor`,
//! `parent`, `same-file`), by value (`text`, `same-text`, `kind`), or
//! recursively — rewrites turn derived rows into byte-range edits built from
//! templates, and `(lint ...)` declarations turn derived rows into located
//! findings filtered by `astlog-ignore` suppression comments. See
//! `packages/astlog/README.md` for the language and the prior art this
//! composes.
