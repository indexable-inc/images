//! scipql-core: a SCIP semantic index lowered into Soufflé datalog facts, with
//! datalog queries and find/replace edits over the resolved symbols.
//!
//! Unlike `astlog` (datalog over tree-sitter syntax), the facts here are keyed
//! by SCIP *monikers*, so a query distinguishes two same-named symbols in
//! different modules and a rewrite touches only the real definition and its
//! references. The pipeline is: [`index`] (run `rust-analyzer scip`) →
//! [`load_index`] + [`facts_from_index`] (lower to relations) → [`query`] /
//! [`fix`] / [`rename`] (run Soufflé; a `fix` program emits an `edit` relation
//! applied via `edit-applier`).
//!
//! Every entry point takes an explicit `root` for the source tree (defaulting
//! to the index's `project_root`): byte offsets and on-disk writes resolve
//! relative document paths against it.
