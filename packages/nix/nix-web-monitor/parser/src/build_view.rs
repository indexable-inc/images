//! The compact build-tree render model.
//!
//! [`MonitorSnapshot`](crate::MonitorSnapshot) is the full state the web UI
//! consumes over its delta protocol: every activity, a 500-line log tail, the
//! dependency DAG, daemon syscalls, the switch activation subtree. That is far
//! more than a small "what is this build doing right now" pane needs, and its
//! log tail changes every line -- pathological for a dashboard body that is
//! diffed wholesale on each tick.
//!
//! [`BuildView`] is the projection of that state a build-tree pane actually
//! renders: the derivations (with status and phase), a few in-flight non-build
//! activities (fetches, copies) with their progress, the aggregate counters,
//! and a capped error list. It is owned here, alongside the parser, so the
//! kernel's headless emitter and the dashboard's `nix-build` renderer share one
//! definition of the model instead of each re-deriving it. Bounded by
//! construction (`ERROR_LIMIT`, `ACTIVITY_LIMIT`), so the serialized body stays
//! small no matter how verbose the build.
