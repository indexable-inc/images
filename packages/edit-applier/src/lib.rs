//! Apply byte-range edits to source files and render a unified diff.
//!
//! A consumer derives a set of [`Edit`]s (a byte range in some file, and the
//! text to splice in its place) from whatever analysis it runs, then hands them
//! here to be checked for overlap, applied, and diffed. The logic is corpus-
//! agnostic on purpose: `astlog` produces edits from tree-sitter rewrite
//! templates, `scipql` from Soufflé `edit` relations over a SCIP index, and both
//! share this one apply/diff/overlap path so the splice semantics can't drift.
//!
//! Edits are keyed by `file`, an index into the `files`/`paths` slice the caller
//! passes, so the caller owns the file numbering. Callers must sort edits before
//! [`check_overlaps`] (apply is order-independent within a file because it
//! splices right-to-left).
