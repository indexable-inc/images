//! The live overlay: one transparent, always-on-top, borderless window **per
//! bar**, each sized to just that bar. winit owns the windows and event loop; the
//! SQLite watcher runs on its own thread and wakes the loop with a fresh
//! `Vec<BossBar>` whenever the database changes.
//!
//! Because each window covers only its bar, the desktop is click-through
//! everywhere else automatically: there is simply no window to intercept the
//! mouse off a bar. Hovering a bar fires native `CursorEntered`/`CursorLeft` (the
//! bar paints opaque, the cursor becomes a grab hand); pressing it hands off to
//! the native `Window::drag_window`, so the OS owns the drag and the new position
//! is read back from `Moved` and persisted. A two-finger trackpad scroll over a
//! bar nudges it the same way: a scroll has no button for `drag_window` to own, so
//! the overlay moves the window itself ([`overlay_core::scroll_drag_delta`]). The
//! press/drag/click disambiguation is [`overlay_core::DragClick`]; the GPU
//! bring-up, surface config, and non-activating raise are [`overlay_core::window`].
