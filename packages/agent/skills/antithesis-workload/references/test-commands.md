# Test Commands

## Goal

Create test templates whose commands exercise the SUT in useful, diverse ways.

## Test Template Structure

A test template is a directory at `/opt/antithesis/test/v1/{name}/` containing test command files. A timeline runs commands from one test template. If you are unsure how to split coverage, start with one template.

A template must contain at least one of: `parallel_driver_`, `serial_driver_`, `singleton_driver_`, or `anytime_` commands. The other command types (`first_`, `eventually_`, `finally_`) only run relative to drivers or anytime commands, so a template with none of the four has nothing for Antithesis to schedule.

Files and subdirectories prefixed with `helper_` are ignored by Antithesis, so use that prefix for shared helpers that need to live inside the template. Any non-helper executable placed directly in a template should be a real test command with a valid prefix.

Any container with test templates must be kept running (e.g., via `sleep infinity` in the entrypoint). If the container exits, Antithesis cannot execute its commands.

Multiple containers can reference the same test template path. When containers `client-a` and `client-b` both have `/opt/antithesis/test/v1/main/`, Antithesis treats both sets as one template, with each command executing in its source container.

## Test Command Requirements

A test command is an executable file whose filename starts with a recognized prefix. It must:

- Be marked executable by the container's default user
- Be a compiled binary or have a shebang line (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- Eventually exit
- Never emit `setup_complete` — test commands only run after Antithesis receives it, so emitting it from a test command deadlocks startup

Symlinks to existing scripts are supported.

## Test Command Prefixes and Their Behavior

### `first_`

- **Purpose:** One-time per-timeline initialization.
- **Scheduling:** Runs after `setup_complete` but before all other commands. If multiple `first_` commands exist, Antithesis selects exactly one.
- **Faults:** Not injected.
- **Concurrency:** No other commands run alongside.
- **Notes:** The `setup_complete` deadlock risk (see Test Command Requirements) is especially easy to trigger here, since `first_` commands handle initialization logic.

### `parallel_driver_`

- **Purpose:** Concurrent, repeated tasks — writes, reads, transactions, API calls.
- **Scheduling:** Runs after `first_` (if any) or immediately after `setup_complete`. Runs concurrently and repeatedly.
- **Faults:** Injected normally, including mid-execution.
- **Concurrency:** Multiple instances can run simultaneously. `anytime_` commands may also run alongside.

### `serial_driver_`

- **Purpose:** Operations that must not overlap with other drivers.
- **Scheduling:** Runs repeatedly, but only one at a time. Starts after `first_` (if any) or immediately after `setup_complete`.
- **Faults:** Injected normally.
- **Concurrency:** Only `anytime_` commands may run alongside. No other drivers run concurrently.

### `singleton_driver_`

- **Purpose:** Exclusive operations that run exactly once per timeline.
- **Scheduling:** Runs once, after `first_` (if any) or immediately after `setup_complete`.
- **Faults:** Injected normally.
- **Concurrency:** Only `anytime_` commands may run alongside.
- **Use cases:** Porting existing test suites, monolithic workloads, proof-of-concept testing.

### `anytime_`

- **Purpose:** Continuous invariant checks.
- **Scheduling:** Runs after `first_`, during any subsequent phase — including during driver execution and while `eventually_` or `finally_` commands start.
- **Faults:** Active during driver phases. When `eventually_` or `finally_` runs, faults stop, but already-running `anytime_` commands complete.
- **Concurrency:** May run alongside any command type except `first_`.
- **Examples:** "Read reflects previous write," availability monitoring.

### `eventually_`

- **Purpose:** Check system recovery and eventually-true invariants — eventual consistency, convergence, availability after faults.
- **Scheduling:** Runs only after at least one driver has started. Kills other running commands when it starts (except `anytime_`, which completes).
- **Faults:** All fault injection stops when this command starts.
- **Concurrency:** Running `anytime_` commands complete; no new commands start alongside.
- **Notes:** The timeline branch will not resume testing after this command runs, so destructive actions are safe. Should include retry loops or health checks since the system may need time to stabilize after faults stop. If you need a mid-run liveness check where testing continues afterward, use `ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS` instead (see Requesting Quiet Periods from Driver Commands).

### `finally_`

- **Purpose:** Check final system state after all work completes.
- **Scheduling:** Runs only after all started drivers complete naturally (not killed). Kills other running commands when it starts (except `anytime_`, which completes). Only runs on timelines where drivers finished on their own.
- **Faults:** All fault injection stops when this command starts.
- **Concurrency:** Running `anytime_` commands complete; no new commands start alongside.
- **Notes:** The timeline branch will not resume testing after this command runs, so destructive actions are safe. Should include retry loops or health checks since the system may need time to stabilize after faults stop.
- **Examples:** "Database contains exactly N rows," final consistency checks.

## `eventually_` vs. `finally_`

These two command types are similar but serve different purposes:

| Aspect | `eventually_` | `finally_` |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Question answered | "Does the system recover?" | "Is the final state correct?" |
| When it runs | After driver(s) start | After all drivers complete naturally |
| How drivers end | Killed by Antithesis | Completed on their own |
| Faults | Stopped | Stopped |
| Destructive actions | Safe — branch won't resume | Safe — branch won't resume |

## Concurrency Summary

| Command | Faults active? | Can run alongside |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| `first_` | No | Nothing |
| `parallel_driver_` | Yes | `parallel_driver_`, `anytime_` |
| `serial_driver_` | Yes | `anytime_` |
| `singleton_driver_` | Yes | `anytime_` |
| `anytime_` | Yes (during drivers) | Any except `first_`; during `eventually_`/`finally_`, running instances complete but new ones are not started |
| `eventually_` | No | Running `anytime_` commands complete |
| `finally_` | No | Running `anytime_` commands complete |

## Requesting Quiet Periods from Driver Commands

The `eventually_` and `finally_` commands pause faults but are terminal — the timeline branch won't resume afterward. When a driver command needs a mid-run liveness check where testing continues, use the `ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS` mechanism instead.

Antithesis injects an `ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS` binary into every container and sets the corresponding environment variable. To request a quiet period:

```bash
[ "${ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS}" ] && "${ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS}" <DURATION_SECONDS>
```

The guard clause lets the script run harmlessly outside the Antithesis environment (e.g., during local testing).

When invoked:

1. All faults stop — network faults are restored, node faults are cleared, and no new faults are injected for the requested duration.
2. Containers are restored — killed or stopped containers are restarted, but they take some time to become fully operational.
3. Faults resume automatically after the requested duration elapses.
4. Overlapping requests merge — if multiple calls overlap, the quiet period extends to cover the largest interval.

### Liveness Check Pattern

A typical pattern inside a driver command:

1. Run workload operations while faults are active.
2. Call `ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS` with enough seconds for the system to recover.
3. Wait for the system to stabilize (poll for health, retry reads, etc.).
4. Assert liveness properties (e.g., "all replicas eventually converge," "queued work is eventually processed").
5. Resume the workload — faults restart automatically after the quiet period.

This is especially useful during rolling operations (upgrades, config changes, migrations) where you need to verify recovery at each step without ending the timeline.

### When to Use Which

| Mechanism | Faults paused? | Test continues after? | Use case |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| `eventually_` command | Yes | No (terminal branch) | Final liveness validation |
| `finally_` command | Yes | No (terminal branch) | Post-driver invariant checks |
| `ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS` | Yes | Yes (faults resume) | Mid-run recovery checks, rolling operations |

## Design Principles

### Try everything sometimes

The goal is to have some chance of producing any legal sequence of operations against the SUT's API. Exercise the full API surface, including configuration, administration, and setup functions — not just the "main" workflow. These are easy to overlook but tend to hide bugs.

Don't avoid "expected" failures. If the system is supposed to shut down under certain conditions, or crash and recover from specific faults, those paths need to happen in tests. Recovery processes hide a disproportionate number of bugs, and properties like "a surprise shutdown never results in inconsistent data" are just as important as properties about a healthy system.

Exercise concurrency if the system supports it. Multiple clients, concurrent transactions, or pipelined requests should all appear in the workload. The degree of concurrency is a tunable parameter — too much can swamp the system and produce uninteresting failures, too little misses an entire class of bugs.

### Notice misbehavior when it happens

Validate continuously with a work-validate-work pattern, not just at the end. There are three reasons this matters. First, bugs can cancel each other out — the system enters a broken state, then by random luck recovers before a final validation check would notice. Second, debugging is harder when there's a long, irrelevant history between the cause and the detection. Third, it's wasteful to run an entire test to completion before discovering a bug that happened early on.

Distinguish always-properties from eventually-properties. Always-properties (like "a write is reflected in subsequent reads") should be checked continuously. Eventually-properties (like "the system recovers availability after a fault") need a quiet period to verify — use `eventually_` commands or `ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS` depending on whether the timeline should continue afterward. Don't let expected transient failures (network errors, unavailable services during faults) clutter results as false positives; the real property is that the system eventually recovers, not that it never fails.

Some properties only make sense when all work is done — final state consistency, graceful shutdown, aggregate correctness. Use `finally_` commands for these.

### Leverage autonomy

Randomize aggressively. Every decision in a test command is an opportunity for Antithesis to explore the state space: which operations to call, in what order, with what inputs, how the system is configured, how many processes run concurrently, when to validate. The more degrees of freedom, the more interesting behavior Antithesis can discover.

Break commands into the smallest coherent pieces so Antithesis has maximum flexibility in composing test scenarios. Don't tune randomness in ways that rule out valid sequences. A test that always calls `a` twice in a row might find some bugs slightly faster on average, but it can never discover a bug that requires the sequence `a-b-a` without an intervening second `a`. Ruling out valid sequences creates blind spots where bugs hide, and that tradeoff is almost never worth the marginal speedup.

### Vary randomness across timelines

Workload randomness has two axes. The **shape axis**, covered below, is how often each menu item is drawn (probabilities, action weights). The **menu axis** — what values are on the menu in the first place — is covered in `interesting-values.md`. Both apply, and they compose.

Vary the shape of randomness across timelines. Don't hardcode probabilities and action weights as module-level constants. At the start of each timeline, draw those parameters themselves from a wide range — including the extremes — so some timelines are heavily biased toward one class of action and others are biased the other way.

This is not the same as the rule against ruling out valid sequences above. That warns against permanently encoding "always do `a` twice." This rule says reroll the bias per timeline — across many timelines every valid sequence is still reachable; within any one timeline you go deep.

When every step draws uniformly from a large action space, timelines converge toward the typical state and rarely reach the deep states where the interesting bugs hide. A single timeline that's deliberately skewed goes deep into one corner of the state space; across many timelines, the union of skews covers the surface, and finds bugs uniform mixing never reaches. This is sometimes called swarm testing.

The per-timeline bias should also include action omission — the limiting case of skew, where an entire class of action is excluded from the menu for that timeline. For an action vocabulary `[a, b, c, d]`, drop each independently with some small probability at the start of the timeline, and re-roll if the result is empty.

A simple implementation: for each tunable probability, replace `P = 0.3` with `P = random_choice([0.02, 0.3, 0.95])` from the SDK's random module (see `assertions.md`). Three buckets is illustrative; what matters is covering the extremes plus a middle case. For action weights, occasionally zero out one or more entries. Both stay deterministic under replay; both broaden the state space Antithesis can explore.

This matters most when the action space is large. For small vocabularies or one-shot commands (`first_`, `singleton_driver_`) the gains are limited, and the parameters to vary are the ones tuned at the start of the timeline, not per-step decisions.

## Guidance

- Antithesis already checks that commands exit 0, so a non-zero exit should mean something is genuinely wrong.
- Reserve `setup_complete` for a container entrypoint or other long-lived startup process that runs before Antithesis starts executing timeline commands.
- Driver commands connect to the SUT under active fault injection — handle transient network faults gracefully (see `component-implementation.md` for details).
- All randomness in test commands must go through the Antithesis SDK's random module for deterministic replay (see `assertions.md` for details).
- Vary probability and action weights across timelines so different timelines explore different corners of the state space (see "Vary randomness across timelines").
- Write commands in the project's language, not Bash, so they can reuse existing clients, helpers, and libraries.

## Output

One or more test templates containing test command executables written to `antithesis/test/`.
